*Deshaun Watson screams in distance*
Nah you have a point. Honestly when I think about it he’s more Deshaun Watson than either one of them.
Let’s talk about a tough call for fantasy owners this weekend. Deshaun Watson.   NE defense has not allowed more than 214 pass. yards since week one.   No QB has thrown more than one passing TD against them. In fact they have only allowed 4 passing tds to the position.

"Deshaun Watson is the best mobile passer Patriots will have faced to this point—hi-end escapability, can sling it. But he’s also biggest QB ball disruption opportunity they’ll face. 8 fumbles, sacked 6x in 3 different games—bad habit of taking extended play sacks, loose w/ ball."
"It's so hard to EVER sit DeShaun Watson, but I would probably play Darnold if it is must win 🙈."
